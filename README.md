===================

Utilities for LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol), e.g. for getting information on CSIL accounts

This repo is based on the following Mantis ticket:

https://foo.cs.ucsb.edu/56mantis/view.php?id=300

An issue to be addressed is adding more testing (e.g. some JUnit tests)  This may require some "mocking" of interfaces, etc.
